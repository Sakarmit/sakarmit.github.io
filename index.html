            Hello! I'm Smit Sakariya, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science with a
            concentration in AI, robotics, and gaming at the University of North
            Carolina at Charlotte, which I will complete by summer 2026. I am passionate about continuously learning and
            tackling new challenges. With a passion for backend development and debugging, I've honed my skills across
            various languages, including Javascript, Python, C#, and many more, with hands-on projects. Driven by the
            philosophy that giving your best effort is crucial to achieving the best results, I aspire to grow my
            knowledge and connections in the tech industry, with the ultimate goal of founding my own business. I serve
            as an instructional assistant, where I've strengthened my technical knowledge and grown personally,
            overcoming social anxiety and refining my ability to simplify complex concepts.

            Over Summer 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant for Dr. Laurel Powell. The research focused on
            developing a game that teaches students about: logical operators, laws and quantifiers. Unofficially I 
            took on the role of the lead programmer, where I helped design, and implement the game mechanics in 
            Javascript using the Phaser framework. I also handled task management, ensuring that everyone was assigned
            tasks that suited their skills and interests, while also providing support and guidance when needed.
            This experience has significantly enhanced my programming skills, particularly in game development, and
            has deepened my understanding of educational game design. It has also improved my leadership and teamwork
            abilities, as I learned to coordinate effectively with team members and adapt to the dynamic nature of
            game development.

            The game is currently in early prototype stage, and this summer focused on creating first playable sub games.
            The goal was to make the game future proof, so that it can be expanded upon in the future with more funding. 
            Ensuring code was modular and easy to understand was a priority.

            I first worked as an <strong>instructional assistant</strong> for Dr. A B M Mohaimenur Rahman.
            I was an IA for Web Development course during the Spring and Summer 2024 semesters.
            I am an IA for Logic and Algorithms course during the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semester.
            Being an IA has helped me improve my skills in communication and task management.
            I was required to communicate with students with questions they may have about assignments.
            I was also graded assignments where I ensured fairness and provided clear feedback on why
            points may have been taken off.
